# ABOUT

The official Written? Kitten! is now at <http://writtenkitten.co/> and the official repository is at https://github.com/joshuawalcher/writtenkitten/.

This is the source code for the deprecated website writtenkitten.net, provided for the
interest of anyone who'd like to know how it worked, or to adapt it for their own
use. writtenkitten.net is now deprecated. 

The website and the code are provided "as is" and we don't have any particular
plans to support or improve them, though if you were to send us something 
awesome me might consider it.
